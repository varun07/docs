FUNCTION IN JAVASCRIPT

aruments object
The arguments object is not an Array. It is similar to an Array, but does not have any Array properties except length. For example, it does not have the pop method. However it can be converted to a real Array: 
	var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
	
You can also use the Array.from() method or the spread operator to convert arguments to a real Array:
	var args = Array.from(arguments);
	var args = [...arguments];
	
arguments.callee property contains the currently executing function.
Why was arguments.callee removed from ES5 strict mode? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments/callee

JavaScriptCore has hard-coded argument limit of 65536
